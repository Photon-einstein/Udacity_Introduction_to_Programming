# Introduction-to-Programming-Nanodegree

The goal of me taking this course is to gain more knowledge at Web development and Python. With this course I can then move to more advanced courses in Python for example.

This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Introduction to Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000).
